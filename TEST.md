  ## Installation

  There are so many steps that I'll probably hneed to break these up as well

  ## Usage

  Some base instructison that may need to into a list too

  To add a screenshot, create an `assets/images` folder in your repository and upload your screenshot to it. Then, using the relative filepath, add it to your README using the following syntax:

      ```md
      ![The Project](./assets/img.png)
      ```

  Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
